# What is this?
A batch script program that modifies smd animation files to work with the proportion trick.

It's usually more noticeable when the resulting custom model is smaller than the original models, then the original model animations cause the smaller model to bounce.

# How to use.
1. Multiply your animations by a value. Less than 1 makes any movements less noticeable. Higher than 1 makes them more pronounced.(note this only affects translations not rotations) 
2. Set Scale to 1.0 and start tweaking the Vertical Offset value with positive or negative values, while checking hlmv, until the character is grounded.
